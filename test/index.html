          <h2 class="sub-title">How we met</h2>

          <p>
            Our love story began on the Internet (which we can both credit with many great things in our lives). We had both joined match.com about the same time, and were interested in each others' profiles, both featuring computer nerdery and reference to obscure musical theater and fantasy novels.</p>
            <!-- <br/> -->
            <p>After about a week of messaging, we agreed to meet at the Newseum. DC protests prevented us from meeting there but we relocated and spent the whole day lunching, exploring historic homes and referencing Doctor Who.</p>
            <!-- <br/> -->
            <p>One date led to many -- as we explored comic book stores, museums, Great Falls Park and more. Captivated by each others' passion, intellect and quirkiness, we soon were texting and chatting most nights.</p>
            <!-- <br/> -->
            <p>In March 2021, Paul and Michelle went on a trip to Chicago to visit Michelle's mom. While there, the couple went to a dinner at Michelle's cousins' house. After the meal, Paul explained how much family meant to him, then said he would be honored to join theirs, and asked Michelle to marry him! She of course said (screamed) yes! Unbeknownst to Michelle, Paul had sneakily asked Ruth and his parents for their blessing earlier that day.</p>
            <!-- <br/> -->
            <p>We both love to travel and have taken day trips and hiking excursions through the DC area, as well as longer trips to Colorado, Texas, Illinois and Michigan. We have dreams of much more national and international travel. Sharing and discussing experiences, exchanging our knowledge of different lifestyles as well as the cultural and culinary arts, we are each others' favorite travel partners.</p>
            <!-- <br/> -->
            <p>We have been with each other through job changes, deaths, and hospital visits. Each experience has helped us grow stronger as a couple and fall deeper in love.</p>
            <!-- <br/> -->
            <p>We can't wait to commit to each other in the eyes of both our religions and cultures and make a lifetime promise to each other. We are delighted to share this time with you as we rejoice in our love and our lives together!</p>

                                Heather Battaglia and Michelle met in their early journalism careers in 2011 in DC. They coded together, closed down restaurants talking and even led an impromptu session on the Python language and Django framework while sitting on the floor in a hallway at a conference. Heather now works as a project manager for the federal website development firm 18F. We are thrilled to have Heather be a part of this special day, appreciating her bubbly and loyal personality as well as her creativity technical and otherwise.

                                Sarah Gipp and Michelle have been close friends since attending the same private middle school where they met through choir and the literary magazine. They spent time together reading (and attending bookstore launch parties for Harry Potter) and writing (Sarah loves writing fanfic). Sarah works in Chicago as a paralegal. Through the years, while much has changed, their friendship is just as strong. Sarah's kindness, nerdy quirkiness and long history with Michelle makes her a key part of our wedding day, and we are so happy to have her!

                                    <p style='width:200%;'>Sarah Gipp and Michelle have been close friends since attending the same private middle school where they met through choir and the literary magazine. They spent time together reading (and attending bookstore launch parties for Harry Potter) and writing (Sarah loves writing fanfic). Sarah works in Chicago as a paralegal. Through the years, while much has changed, their friendship is just as strong. Sarah's kindness, nerdy quirkiness and long history with Michelle makes her a key part of our wedding day, and we are so happy to have her!</p>
