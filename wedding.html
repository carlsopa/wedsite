            <h3>Michelle and Paul are tying the knot!</h3>
            <p>Welcome to our wedding website, we can’t wait to celebrate our special day with you. Being as we are both programmers, we have of course created this website from scratch with love, keeping you close in mind! We’ve created this place on the Internet as a convenient and interactive way to share all of the important details with you in the lead up to our wedding. You can also read more about our love story, get to know our awesome bridal party, check out some pics of us from the past four years, and check out our registry information too. Have fun, take a look around and don’t forget to RSVP, share your own first dance or other favorite songs, and share your favorite recipes for our wedding cookbook (this can all be done here, or via the cards in invitations you will receive)! Finally – thank you for your ongoing love and support. We are so excited to make this commitment, take the next step in our lives together with the support of our communities, share this day with you and look forward to dancing the night away with all of our favorite people! </p>  
          </div> 
          <h1 class="title">Our story</h1>
          <p>
            Our love story began on the Internet (which we can both credit more many great things in our lives). We had both joined match.com about the same time, and were interested in each others' profiles, both featuring computer nerdery and reference to obscure musical theater and fantasy novels. One message from Paul became several back-and-forth. In these messages, Paul told Michelle his favorite song from Broadway is "The Impossible Dream" from Man of La Mancha, and he didn't know how truly apt that would describe their relationship going forward.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>After about a week, we agreed to meet at the Newseum (a place Paul thoughtfully chose in public and because he knew Michelle was a journalist). DC protests prevented us from meeting there but we relocated to Dupont Circle, a neigborhood in DC and spent the whole day lunching, exploring historic homes, chatting and referencing Dr. Who. This was both of our first in-person online dates.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>One date led to a second, and a fifth, and more -- as we explored comic book stores, museums, mini golf, Great Falls Park, Manassas Battlefield and so much more. Captivated by each others' warmth, passion, intellect, quirkiness and more, we soon were texting and chatting most nights.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>A year later we moved to a townhouse in DC in the Adams Morgan neighborhood, and two years after that, moved to the burbs to a townhouse in Manassas, Va.(not far from one of our first dates).</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Not long after moving to Manassas, Paul and Michelle went to Chicago to visit her mom, Ruth, and help with some appointments. While out there, we went to a Shabbat (Sabbath) dinner at Michelle's cousins' Susan and David's house. After an enjoyable yet relative typical meal, during dessert Paul explained how much family meant to him and appreciated getting to know the family, then saying he would be honored to join it, and asked Michelle to marry him! She of course said (screamed) yes! Unbeknownst to Michelle, Paul had sneakily asked Ruth and his parents for their blessing earlier that day.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>We both love to travel and have taken day trips and done hiking through DC, Maryland and Virginia, as well as longer trips to Colorado, Texas, Illinois, Michigan and road tripping from DC to Detroit and Chicago. We have dreams of much more national and international travel. Sharing and discussing experiences, exchanging our knowledge of different lifestyles as well as the cultural and culinary arts, we are each others' favorite travel partners.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>We have been with each other through job changes, deaths, weddings, countless ER visits thanks to side effects from Michelle's kidney transplant and hyperactive immune system. Yet, each experience has helped us grow stronger as a couple and fall deeper in love.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>We already embody being with each other through it all no matter what happens, and can't wait to commit to each other in the eyes of both our religions and cultures, our communities and most of all, make a lifetime promise to each other, and are delighted to share this time with you as we rejoice in our love and this new step in our lives together!</p>

              <div class='name'>Paul Carlson</div>
              <p>
                Paul Robert Carlson is a retail manager and programmer. He was born in Minnesota, and grew up in a small town called Marshall, went to college for archeology in South Dakota, later moving to Midland, Michigan and Detroit, and eventually Washington DC. He worked at Kmart for close to ten years, a career that runs in the family as his father and uncle worked for Kmart stores as well. His hobbies include balloon twisting and performing magic, as well as tinkering with electronics and anything on the computer. He and Michelle both share a love of technology, hiking, sci-fi fantasy and musical theater.

              <p>
                Michelle Elyse Minkoff is a data journalist, meaning she uses technology and computer programming to tell stories in the news. She's worked as an adjunct professor for Northwestern, and given talks in the field across the United States. She was born and raised in the Illinois suburbs, born in Hinsdale, Ill., and lived in Downers Grove, Arlington Heights and Palatine, all in Illinois. She went to college in Massachsetts and grad school at Northwestern in Evanston, Ill, and Washington DC. Later, she lived in Los Angeles, Calif., and then returned to DC. Her hobbies include arts and crafts, reading everything she can get her hand on, cooking (no recipe is unsurmountable), yoga and hiking. She and Paul both share a love of technology, hiking, sci-fi fantasy and musical theater.

              <p>
                Sara Peralta and Michelle met when Sara came to DC in 2014 for an internship at NPR. Sara was referred to Michelle to get to know DC by one of Sara's grad school professors, a mutual friend. What could have been a one-time quick meetup turned into a multi-year friendship. The two were inseperable and could be found at the same journalism meetups, Jeopardy tapings, live theater events and more, and frequented the same gym sharing session times for more than a year. Sara moved away from DC in 2016, but she and Michelle are always in close touch. Sara's big heart, great sense of humor, never-ending caring, and a multitude of shared passions with Michelle mean so much, and we are so pleased to have her personality and organizing skills as a key part of our big day!

              <p>
                Erik Carlson is Paul's younger brother by four years, who works in sales at Zoom, a place we have all come to know and love during the pandemic. We cherish Erik's sense of humor and gracious hosting skills, and an ability (much like his and Paul's dad) to make everyone feel at ease during any conversation.

              <p>
                Heather Battaglia and Michelle met through journalism Twitter, email lists and the conference circuit in the early 2010s. For a time, both were in DC, but even after being separated by miles, every conversation felt natural and was likely to continue for hours. Michelle remembers coding with Heather working on respective projects at Michelle's kitchen table. Michelle and Heather also were well known in the journalism community as two of the first female journalism/programmers of their generation who quickly went into top-tier news organizations after graduation. They even led an impromptu session on the Python language and Django framework while sitting on the floor in a hallway at a conference, keeping in touch with many of the dozens of attendees over years. Heather now works as a project manager for the federal website development firm 18F. We are thrilled to have Heather be a part of this special day, appreciating her bubbly and loyal personality as well as her creativity technical and otherwise.

              <p>
               Sarah Gipp and Michelle have been the best of friends since attending the same private elementary and middle school, Quest Academy, in Palatine, Ill. They met in the late 1990's, when Michelle was in seventh grade, and Sarah was in sixth. They got to know each other through choir and the school literary magazine. They spent time together reading (and attending bookstore launch parties for Harry Potter) and writing (Sarah loved writing fanfic, a hobby continued to this day). They also love theater and attended many productions in downtown Chicago with their parents, and the families even went on a European cruise together. Sarah works in Chicago as a paralegal. Through the years, while much has changed, their friendship is just as strong. Sarah's kindness, nerdy quirkiness and long history with Michelle makes her a key part of our wedding day, and we are so happy to have her!

              <p>
               Kristen Minogue and Michelle went to Northwestern's journalism graduate school together in 2009-10. Due to ending up next to each other in everything alphabetical (same first three letters of last name), sharing the same health and science specialization, and both ending up in DC, they spent a lot of time together and became fast friends, sharing journalistic and fantasy/sci-fi interests. Kristen now works in public relations for the Smithsonian's Environemtal Reserch Center in Maryland. The two enjoy meeting up and chatting about their shared interests. We appreciate Kristen's calm and easy-going nature, her kind heart and soul, and how she always relishes others' joy as much and possibily more than her own. She is a true loyal friend and we are grateful to have her as part of the wedding party!
