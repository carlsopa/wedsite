              <div class='name'>Paul Carlson</div>
              <p>
                Paul Robert Carlson is a retail manager at the Lidl grocery stores and freelance programmer. He was born in Minnesota, went to college for archeology in South Dakota, later moving to Midland, Michigan and Detroit, and eventually Washington DC. He worked at Kmart for close to ten years, a career that runs in the family as his father and uncle worked for Kmart stores as well. His hobbies include balloon twisting and performing magic, as well as tinkering with electronics and anything on the computer. He and Michelle both share a love of technology, hiking, sci-fi fantasy and musical theater.

              <div class='name'>Michelle Minkoff</div>
              <p>
                Michelle Elyse Minkoff is a data journalist at the Associated Press, meaning she uses technology and computer programming to tell stories in the news. She's worked as an adjunct professor for Northwestern, and given talks in the field across the United States. She was born and raised in the Illinois suburbs. She went to college in Massachusetts and graduate school at Northwestern in Evanston, Ill, and Washington DC. Her hobbies include arts and crafts, reading everything she can get her hands on, cooking, yoga and hiking.

          <h3 class="sub-title">How we met</h2>

          <p>
            Our love story began on the Internet (which we can both credit with many great things in our lives). We had both joined match.com about the same time, and were interested in each others' profiles, both featuring computer nerdery and reference to obscure musical theater and fantasy novels.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>After about a week of messaging, we agreed to meet at the Newseum. DC protests prevented us from meeting there but we relocated and spent the whole day lunching, exploring historic homes and referencing Doctor Who.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>One date led to many -- as we explored comic book stores, museums, Great Falls Park and more. Captivated by each others' passion, intellect and quirkiness, we soon were texting and chatting most nights.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In March 2021, Paul and Michelle went on a trip to Chicago to visit Michelle's mom. While there, the couple went to a dinner at Michelle's cousins' house. After the meal, Paul explained how much family meant to him, then said he would be honored to join theirs, and asked Michelle to marry him! She of course said (screamed) yes! Unbeknownst to Michelle, Paul had sneakily asked Ruth and his parents for their blessing earlier that day.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>We both love to travel and have taken day trips and hiking excursions through the DC area, as well as longer trips to Colorado, Texas, Illinois and Michigan. We have dreams of much more national and international travel. Sharing and discussing experiences, exchanging our knowledge of different lifestyles as well as the cultural and culinary arts, we are each others' favorite travel partners.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>We have been with each other through job changes, deaths, and hospital visits. Each experience has helped us grow stronger as a couple and fall deeper in love.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>We can't wait to commit to each other in the eyes of both our religions and cultures and make a lifetime promise to each other. We are delighted to share this time with you as we rejoice in our love and our lives together!</p>

              <p>
                Sara Peralta and Michelle met when Sara came to DC in 2014 for an internship at NPR and became fast friends attending journalism meetups, Jeopardy tapings, live theater events and the same gym session times. Sara's big heart, great sense of humor, never-ending caring, and a multitude of shared passions with Michelle mean so much, and we are so pleased to have her personality and organizing skills as a key part of our big day!

              <p>
                Erik Carlson is Paul's younger brother by four years, who works in sales at Zoom, a place we have all come to know and love during the pandemic. We cherish Erik's sense of humor and gracious hosting skills, and an ability (much like his and Paul's dad) to make everyone feel at ease during any conversation.

              <p>
                Heather Battaglia and Michelle met in their early journalism careers in 2011 in DC. They coded together, closed down restaurants talking and even led an impromptu session on the Python language and Django framework while sitting on the floor in a hallway at a conference. Heather now works as a project manager for the federal website development firm 18F. We are thrilled to have Heather be a part of this special day, appreciating her bubbly and loyal personality as well as her creativity technical and otherwise.

              <p>
               Sarah Gipp and Michelle have been close friends since attending the same private middle school where they met through choir and the literary magazine. They spent time together reading (and attending bookstore launch parties for Harry Potter) and writing (Sarah loves writing fanfic). Sarah works in Chicago as a paralegal. Through the years, while much has changed, their friendship is just as strong. Sarah's kindness, nerdy quirkiness and long history with Michelle makes her a key part of our wedding day, and we are so happy to have her!

               Kristen Goodhue and Michelle went to Northwestern's journalism graduate school together in 2009 sharing the same health and science specialization, and both ending up in DC. Kristen now works in public relations for the Smithsonian's Environemtal Reserch Center in Maryland. We appreciate Kristen's calm and easy-going nature and how she always relishes others' joy as much and possibily more than her own. We are grateful to have her as part of the wedding party!
